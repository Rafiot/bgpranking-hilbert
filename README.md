Reuse the excellent code provided by the [Census 2012](http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/hilbert.html)
with a newer version of Openlayers, some cleanup and updates in the code to
generate the map faster.

It needs a lot of work, but the plan it to generate an animated map of IPs gathered in
[BGP Ranking](http://bgpranking.circl.lu/) over the time.
